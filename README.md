## Todo:

- content
    - transfer and update/revise all posts from current FBE
    - set up image hosting
    - copy all examples over from current FBE, and make sure they're correct
    - write more!
    
- client
    - ~~support subfolders in routes~~
    - ~~syntax highlighting~~
    - ~~initial styling blog post in general~~
    - potentially add Disqus comments?
    - potentially add interactive feature to run code?
    - implement search
    - add `User` feature, allowing users to log in and save progress.
        - Probably should use Firestore for this: easy, built in Auth.
    - add mailing list form
    - rewrite in Flutter for web
    
- server
    - validate frontmatter
    - support sub folders for table of contents
        - ~~getting TOC supports sub folders~~
        - ~~getting single page should search through all subfolders and find the one that matches the request~~
            - ~~i.e.: "/content/test.md" will find "/content/dart/test.md"~~
        - v2: implement a cache on the server
    - implement API for search

- deploy
    - Add Travis CI/CD with github hook
    - deploy both client and server with either k8s/GCP or Heroku
