The first step to using Flutter is installing the Flutter SDK, which will also install Dart. Follow this super in-depth guide to get started [Flutter.io Getting Started Guide](https://flutter.io).

### Choose an Editor with Dart Plugins

You can use whichever text editor you'd like to write Dart code, but you'll have a much more productive experience if you choose an IDE with Flutter support.

### 1. IntelliJ Idea

I highly recommend [JetBrains Intellij IDEA](https://www.jetbrains.com/idea/). The community edition is free.

This IDE will give you all the nice features you'd want for any language: code completion, snippets, error highlighting, linting, etc. You'll also get killer debugging features. There's a browser-dev-tools style Inspector and more in the debug tools.

In order to use IntelliJ, you'll need to install the Dart and Flutter plugins within IntelliJ.

### 2. VS Code

The Dart community has built a Dart plugin for VS code which has Flutter
feature support. It won't be as robust, but it's a fine alternative.

## Pub and Libraries

`pub` is the Dart package management system. There's a website where can browse, search and get info about all the available packages for Dart and Flutter.

[Dart Pub Packages](https://pub.dartlang.org/)

## Gitter

If you run into any problems, you can ask for help in real time on the [Flutter Gitter Channel](https://gitter.im/flutter/flutter). There you'll find Flutter team members from Google as well as a supportive community of fans.

## Flutter Docs

Finally, I sincerely find Flutter's documentation is among the best I've come across: [Flutter Widget Docs](https://flutter.io/widgets/)
