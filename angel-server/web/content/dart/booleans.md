`bool` is the Dart type that represents a boolean value.  It can be `true` or `false`.

```dart
// assign directly
bool isPortland = true;
bool isWinter = true;

// You can combine booleans with &&, ||, and other symbols
// if isPortland is true AND isWinter is true
bool isRaining = isPortland && isWinter;
```

There are other built in types that deal with _collections_. You can find those on the next page.
