In the previous lesson, you saw a program that print's "Hello, World" to the console.

```dart
void main() {
  print('Hello, World!');
}
```

The important part of this sample is the only line within the `main` function. 

```dart
print('Hello, World!');
```

`print` is used to log to the console. It's often helpful when you're debugging a Dart program.
