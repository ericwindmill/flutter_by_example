The documentation for Dart and (especially) Flutter are fantastic. It's clear that Google has put a great deal of time into the entire ecosystem. If you need a quick reference, or additional examples to compliment Flutter by Example, you can find Dart documentation at [dart.dev] and Flutter documentation at [flutter.dev].

### Pub

[Pub](pub.dev) is Dart's dependency management system and library. If you're looking for an open-sourced library to solve a problem for any Dart (and Flutter) program, you'll find there.
