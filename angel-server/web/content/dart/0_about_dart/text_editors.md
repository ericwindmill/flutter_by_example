For Flutter and Dart use, I can only recommend these two text editors:

* VS Code
* JetBrains Intellij (or Android Studio)

Both of these editors have officially-supported plugins for Dart. 

VSCode is probably the best completely free IDE that exists. Every web developer on the planet is jumping ship to VSCode. It's the return of the IDE in the web world. And it's a fantastic option.

That said, Intellij is truly full-featured, and that's what I recommend its use. An unfortunate part of writing code is that we also have to deal with managing a project, and an IDE like Intellij makes your life much easier on that front. Intellij Community Edition is free, and the Dart and Flutter features are fully supported in the free version.
