Dart also supports a nice shorthand syntax for any function that has only one expression. In other words, is the code inside the function block only one line? Then it's probably a single expression, and you can use this syntax to be concise:

```dart
String makeGreeting(String name) => 'Hello, $name';
```

For lack of better term, we'll call this an _arrow function_. Arrow functions implicitly return the result of the expression. `=> expression;` is essentially the same as `{ return expression; }`. There's no need to (and you can't) include the `return` keyword.
