Dart supports three kinds of comments:

```dart
// Inline comments

/*
Blocks of comments. It's not convention to use block comments in Dart.
*/

/// Documentation
///
/// This is what you should use to document your classes.
```

Generally, documentation comments with three slashes are used for documenting your code. Anything you think will stay in the code forever should use this style of comments. Inline comments are used for brief insights into something on a specific line.
