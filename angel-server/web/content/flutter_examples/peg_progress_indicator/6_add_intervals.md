Back on track, time to make those bars dance. First, lets add the AnimationController and Tween objects to the app.

```dart
class PegProgressIndicator extends StatefulWidget {
  @override
  _PegProgressIndicatorState createState() => _PegProgressIndicatorState();
}

class _PegProgressIndicatorState extends State<PegProgressIndicator> with TickerProviderStateMixin {
  AnimationController _controller;
  Tween<double> tween;

  @override
  initState() {
    super.initState();
    _controller = AnimationController(
      duration: const Duration(milliseconds: 3000),
      vsync: this,
    );
    tween = Tween<double>(begin: 0.0, end: 1.00);
    _controller.repeat().orCancel;
  }

  @override
  dispose() {
    _controller?.dispose();
    super.dispose();
  }

  @override
    Widget build(BuildContext context) {
      return  Container(
        child: Center(
          child: Row(
            mainAxisAlignment: MainAxisAlignment.center,
            children: <Widget>[
             Peg()
             Peg()
             Peg()
             Peg()
            ],
          ),
        ),
      );
    }
  }
```

### Adding Tweens and Intervals

The main challenge of this animation is that it requires 8 separate
steps to the overall animation, controlled by one AnimationController, distributed over only 4 widgets.

There are 8 steps in this animation because each of the four bars makes a
180degree pivot twice, and by the end of the animation they've all turned a
full turn.

Luckily, Flutter also provides a way to make animations that only occur during
certain times of a `Tween`. It's called an Interval.

You're going to have to write an Interval for each of the eight steps. Here's
the explanation of one:

```dart
class _PegProgressIndicatorState extends State<PegProgressIndicator> 
    with TickerProviderStateMixin {
  AnimationController _controller;
  Tween<double> tween;

  @override
  initState() {
    super.initState();
    _controller = new AnimationController(
      duration: const Duration(milliseconds: 3000),
      vsync: this,
    );
    tween = new Tween<double>(begin: 0.0, end: 1.00);
    _controller.repeat().orCancel;
  }

  @override
  dispose() {
    _controller?.dispose();
    super.dispose();
  }

  // START NEW
  // Animations always start with tweens, but you can reuse tweens.
  Animation<double> get stepOne => tween.animate(
        // For intervals, you can pass in an Animation rather than
        // the controller
        new CurvedAnimation(
          // But pass in the controller here
          parent: _controller,
          // The interval is basically what point of the tween
          // to start at, and what point to end at
          // this tween is 0 to 1,
          // so step one should only animate the first 1/8 of the tween
          // which is 0 to 0.125
          curve: new Interval(
            0.0,
            0.125,
            // the style curve to pass.
            curve: Curves.linear,
          ),
        ),
      );
// ...
```

Once you've written all 8 intervals, you're going to need the widgets that
actually animate during each of these 8 steps. Below you can find all 8 intervals for convenient copy and pasting.

```dart
  Animation<double> get stepOne => tween.animate(
        CurvedAnimation(
          parent: _controller,
          curve: Interval(
            0.0,
            0.125,
            curve: Curves.linear,
          ),
        ),
      );
  Animation<double> get stepTwo => tween.animate(
        CurvedAnimation(
          parent: _controller,
          curve: Interval(
            0.125,
            0.26,
            curve: Curves.linear,
          ),
        ),
      );
  Animation<double> get stepThree => tween.animate(
        CurvedAnimation(
          parent: _controller,
          curve: Interval(
            0.25,
            0.375,
            curve: Curves.linear,
          ),
        ),
      );
  Animation<double> get stepFour => tween.animate(
        CurvedAnimation(
          parent: _controller,
          curve: Interval(
            0.375,
            0.5,
            curve: Curves.linear,
          ),
        ),
      );
  Animation<double> get stepFive => tween.animate(
        CurvedAnimation(
          parent: _controller,
          curve: Interval(
            0.5,
            0.625,
            curve: Curves.linear,
          ),
        ),
      );
  Animation<double> get stepSix => tween.animate(
        CurvedAnimation(
          parent: _controller,
          curve: Interval(
            0.625,
            0.75,
            curve: Curves.linear,
          ),
        ),
      );
  Animation<double> get stepSeven => tween.animate(
        CurvedAnimation(
          parent: _controller,
          curve: Interval(
            0.75,
            0.875,
            curve: Curves.linear,
          ),
        ),
      );
  Animation<double> get stepEight => tween.animate(
        CurvedAnimation(
          parent: _controller,
          curve: Interval(
            0.875,
            1.0,
            curve: Curves.linear,
          ),
        ),
      );
