### 1. Create Dog Card Widget

We need a nice widget to display our doggos.

First you'll make a card that looks like this:

![dog card](https://res.cloudinary.com/ericwindmill/image/upload/v1521328467/flutter_by_example/Screen_Shot_2018-03-10_at_10.28.18_AM.png)

Create a new file called 'dog_card.dart`.

In that file, make a new, blank `StatefulWidget`. It should take a Dog in its constructor.

For the time being, all this will do is display the name of a dog.

```dart
// dog_card.dart

import 'package:flutter/material.dart';

import 'dog_model.dart';

class DogCard extends StatefulWidget {
  final Dog dog;

  DogCard(this.dog);

  @override
  _DogCardState createState() => _DogCardState(dog);
}

class _DogCardState extends State<DogCard> {
   Dog dog;

   _DogCardState(this.dog);

  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Text(widget.dog.name);
  }
}
```

In order to make the `DogCard` appear, let's modify the `_MyHomePageState` `build` method in `main.dart`:

```dart
// main.dart

@override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Scaffold(
        appBar: AppBar(
          title: Text(widget.title),
          backgroundColor: Colors.black87,
        ),
        body: Container(
          child: DogCard(initialDoggos[1]), // New code
        ),
    );
  }
```

And import `dog_card.dart`:

```dart
// main.dart

import 'package:flutter/material.dart';

import 'dog_card.dart';
import 'dog_model.dart';
```

Refresh your app and you can see that it's wired up now. Time to build the card.

### 2. Dog Card UI

There are two main parts to this card. The image, and the actual Card that sits under it.

First, make that image.

Add this getter to you `_DogCardState` class:

```dart
// dog_card.dart

// A class property that represents the URL flutter will render
// from the Dog class.
String renderUrl;

Widget get dogImage {
  return Container(
      // You can explicitly set heights and widths on Containers.
      // Otherwise they take up as much space as their children.
    width: 100.0,
    height: 100.0,
      // Decoration is a property that lets you style the container.
      // It expects a BoxDecoration.
    decoration: BoxDecoration(
      // BoxDecorations have many possible properties.
      // Using BoxShape with a background image is the
      // easiest way to make a circle cropped avatar style image.
      shape: BoxShape.circle,
      image: DecorationImage(
        // Just like CSS's `imagesize` property.
        fit: BoxFit.cover,
        // A NetworkImage widget is a widget that
        // takes a URL to an image.
        // ImageProviders (such as NetworkImage) are ideal
        // when your image needs to be loaded or can change.
        // Use the null check to avoid an error.
        image: NetworkImage(renderUrl ?? ''),
      ),
    ),
  );
}
```

In order to see this image, you'll first need to tell the Dog class to get that image from the internets.

In your dog card, add this to your `_DogCardState` class:

```dart
// dog_card.dart

// State classes run this method when the state is created.
// You shouldn't do async work in initState, so we'll defer it
// to another method.
void initState() {
  super.initState();
  renderDogPic();
}

// IRL, we'd want the Dog class itself to get the image
// but this is a simpler way to explain Flutter basics
void renderDogPic() async {
  // this makes the service call
  await dog.getImageUrl();
  // setState tells Flutter to rerender anything that's been changed.
  // setState cannot be async, so we use a variable that can be overwritten
  if (mounted) { // Avoid calling `setState` if the widget is no longer in the widget tree.
    setState(() {
      renderUrl = dog.imageUrl;
    });
  }
}
```

Now you have a doggos avatar that's properly getting the URL to render.

In order to get the overlap look of the card, use the built-in widget `Stack`.

The `Stack` widget lays out its children relative to its edges.

In other words, it's CSS's `position, top, bottom, left and right` properties.

Within a stack, you can wrap children in 'Position' widgets, but you don't have to.

* Position wrapped widgets are outside of document flow, to use web development terms. They'll be at position [0,0] by default -- the top corner of the Stack widget.
* Non-wrapped widgets aren't positioned. They stay in normal 'document flow', laid out as a column of widgets by default.

This is how the stack is going to start:

```dart
// dog_card.dart

@override
Widget build(BuildContext context) {
  // Start with a container so we can add layout and style props:
  return Container(
    // Arbitrary number that I decided looked good:
    height: 115.0,
    // A stack takes children, with a list of widgets.
    child: Stack(
      children: <Widget>[
        // position our dog image, so we can explicitly place it.
        // We'll place it after we've made the card.
        Positioned(
        child: dogImage,
        ),
      ],
    ),
  );
}
```

Reload your app to see a picture of a dog in the top corner.

Let's create the card and layout in `_DogCardState`:

```dart
// dog_card.dart

Widget get dogCard {
  // A new container
  // The height and width are arbitrary numbers for styling.
  return Container(
    width: 290.0,
    height: 115.0,
    child: Card(
      color: Colors.black87,
      // Wrap children in a Padding widget in order to give padding.
      child: Padding(
        // The class that controls padding is called 'EdgeInsets'
        // The EdgeInsets.only constructor is used to set
        // padding explicitly to each side of the child.
        padding: const EdgeInsets.only(
          top: 8.0,
          bottom: 8.0,
          left: 64.0,
        ),
        // Column is another layout widget -- like stack -- that
        // takes a list of widgets as children, and lays the
        // widgets out from top to bottom.
        child: Column(
          // These alignment properties function exactly like
          // CSS flexbox properties.
          // The main axis of a column is the vertical axis,
          // `MainAxisAlignment.spaceAround` is equivalent of
          // CSS's 'justify-content: space-around' in a vertically
          // laid out flexbox.
          crossAxisAlignment: CrossAxisAlignment.start,
          mainAxisAlignment: MainAxisAlignment.spaceAround,
          children: <Widget>[
            Text(widget.dog.name,
                // Themes are set in the MaterialApp widget at the root of your app.
                // They have default values -- which we're using because we didn't set our own.
                // They're great for having consistent, app-wide styling that's easily changed.
                style: Theme.of(context).textTheme.headline),
            Text(widget.dog.location,
                style: Theme.of(context).textTheme.subhead),
            Row(
              children: <Widget>[
                Icon(
                  Icons.star,
                ),
                Text(': ${widget.dog.rating} / 10')
              ],
            )
          ],
        ),
      ),
    ),
  );
}
```

Almost there. One more thing you need to do to complete the `DogCard` UI. Add a bit more styling to the main widget in the build method:

```dart
// dog_card.dart

@override
Widget build(BuildContext context) {
  return Padding(
    padding: const EdgeInsets.symmetric(horizontal: 16.0, vertical: 8.0),
    child: Container(
      height: 115.0,
      child: Stack(
        children: <Widget>[
          Positioned(
            left: 50.0,
            child: dogCard,
          ),
          Positioned(top: 7.5, child: dogImage),
        ],
      ),
    ),
  );
}
```
