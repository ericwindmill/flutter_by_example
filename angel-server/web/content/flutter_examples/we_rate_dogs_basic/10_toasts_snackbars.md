Good UX is all about being explicit about what's going on the in app when something updates. So the app should give users feedback in two places:
1. When you try to add a new dog but the form is wrong.
2. When you try to update a dog's rating but the form is wrong.

### 1. Feedback when Adding a New Dog

Only the `submitPup` function needs to be updated in your `new_dog_form` page.

First, some explanation that I glossed over in an earlier lesson:

In the build method on this page, the `RaisedButton` is wrapped in a `Builder`.

A builder creates a new scaffold under the hood. It's a new page, a new `BuildContext`, etc.

This new scaffold is necessary to show `Snackbar`s (aka toasts on the web) because they are an element that is on another page, waiting to be called like any page would be.

The *better* way to do this would be to make a whole new stateless widget that's just a `RaisedButton` that shows a `Snackbar` on pressed.

Anyway, update your `submitPup` method:

```dart
// new_dog_form.dart

void submitPup(context) {
  if (nameController.text.isEmpty) {
    Scaffold.of(context).showSnackBar(
      SnackBar(
        backgroundColor: Colors.redAccent,
        content: Text('Pups neeed names!'),
      ),
    );
  } else {
    var newDog = Dog(nameController.text, locationController.text,
        descriptionController.text);
    Navigator.of(context).pop(newDog);
  }
}
```

Now, try to submit a dog without a name.

### 2. Dialog Feedback when the Rating Form is wrong

This time, you'll implement a `Dialog`, which on mobile is just a modal.

`Dialog`s in Flutter give you access to `actions` so you can do things like ask user questions, get ratings, etc.

We're going to use what's called an `AlertDialog`, which alerts the users of something.

This goes in your `_DogDetailPageState`.

```dart
// dog_detail_page.dart

// Just like a route, this needs to be async, because it can return
// information when the user interacts.
Future<Null> _ratingErrorDialog() async {
  // showDialog is a built-in Flutter method.
  return showDialog(
    context: context,
    builder: (BuildContext context) {
      return AlertDialog(
        title: Text('Error!'),
        content: Text("They're good dogs, Brant."),
        // This action uses the Navigator to dismiss the dialog.
        // This is where you could return information if you wanted to.
        actions: [
          FlatButton(
            child: Text('Try Again'),
            onPressed: () => Navigator.of(context).pop(),
          )
        ],
      );
    },
  );
}
```

Finally, update your `updateRating` method to handle that error:

```dart
void updateRating() {
  if (_sliderValue < 10) {
    _ratingErrorDialog();
  } else {
    setState(() => widget.dog.rating = _sliderValue.toInt());
  }
}
```


Now, when someone tries to give a dog a low rating, we'll stop them.

After all, they're good dogs.
