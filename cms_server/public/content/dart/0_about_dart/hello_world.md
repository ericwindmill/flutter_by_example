Like all good programming tutorials, let's start by printing "Hello, World" to the console. In
 the next few lessons, we'll look at the individual components of this code sample.

```dart
void main() {
  print('Hello, World!');
}
```

```text
Output:
Hello, World!
```

I recommend running this example in [Dartpad](dartpad.dev).
